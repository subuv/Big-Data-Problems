Used Hive to take a movie rating dataset and, for every user: 
  •	compute the average ratings given by the user for different movie genres, and
  •	sort the output first by the user ids (ascending) and then by the average rating (descending)
  
Used an array to store all genres for a movie while creating a table in Hive. The genres are separated by ‘|’, so created a table with collection items tha are separated by ‘|’.  Then to put each genre in its own row, used the “Expand” function along with “Lateral view”. 

There are two input files
movies.dat: This file contains movies information and has the following format (genres are delimited by “|”).
ratings.dat: This file contains ratings given by users to different movies and have the following format.
